    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rajivjha003/Retail-Sales-Prediction/main/sales%20forecast%20cover%20img.png" alt="Rossmann Store">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Rossmann Store Sales Prediction project aims to develop an accurate predictive model that forecasts daily
        sales for over 3,000 drug stores operating in seven European countries. The task involves predicting sales for
        up to six weeks ahead, considering various factors such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and
        store location. The goal is to minimize forecasting errors and achieve high accuracy in predicting sales for
        the test period, considering the individual circumstances of each Rossmann store.</p>

    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data for Rossmann stores, along with relevant factors
        such as promotions, competition, holidays, and seasonality. The dataset is diverse and carefully curated to
        ensure data quality and reliability.</p>
    <h2>Software and Tools Requirement</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>NumPy</li>
        <li>Pandas</li>
        <li>Scikit-learn</li>
        <li>Seaborn</li>
        <li>Matplotlib</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>The Rossmann Store Sales Prediction model employs multiple regression algorithms, including Linear Regression,
        Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest, to forecast daily sales accurately. The project involves the
        following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand sales trends, patterns, and seasonality across Rossmann
            stores.</li>
        <li>Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and engineer relevant features.</li>
        <li>Model Development: Utilize regression algorithms to develop predictive models for each Rossmann store.</li>
        <li>Ensemble Learning: Combine individual model predictions using ensemble techniques to improve forecasting
            accuracy.</li>
        <li>Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters to achieve the best predictive performance.</li>
        <li>Model Evaluation: Assess the models' accuracy and performance using evaluation metrics such as RMSE and
            MAE.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Model Development</h2>
    <p>The Rossmann Store Sales Prediction models are powerful ensembles that leverage the diversity of regression
        algorithms to capture various sales influencing factors. By considering promotions, competition, holidays,
        seasonality, and store location, the models achieve high accuracy and flexibility.</p>
    <h2>Model Evaluation</h2>
    <p>The models' performance is rigorously evaluated to ensure their reliability and effectiveness in forecasting
        sales. Evaluation metrics provide valuable insights into the models' predictive capabilities and their ability to
        handle individual store circumstances.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The Rossmann Store Sales Prediction project demonstrates remarkable accuracy in forecasting daily sales for the
        test period. By incorporating diverse sales factors and leveraging advanced regression algorithms, the models
        deliver reliable predictions, enabling store managers to make informed decisions and optimize their sales
        strategies.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The Rossmann Store Sales Prediction project empowers retailers to make data-driven decisions and accurately
        forecast daily sales for each store. By understanding the impact of promotions, competition, holidays,
        seasonality, and location on sales, retailers can enhance inventory management, improve customer experience, and
        maximize revenue. This project showcases the transformative potential of predictive analytics in the retail
        industry and highlights the importance of tailoring forecasting models to handle individual store circumstances.
